# Northwind Traders Analysis
The Northwind Traders Analysis dataset was obtained from the Maven Northwind Challenge.
The objectives of the Analysis are as follows:
1. To find out the sales trend
2. The top-selling products
3. The top customers of the Northwind Traders
4. To find out the shipping cost in relationship to the sales

Method
Power BI was the tool used for the analysis.
The datasets were imported into Power Query to check the quality of the data.
The datasets given for the challenge were already cleaned. The data were validated to be sure there were no quality issues

The data were then loaded into Power BI where the data were modeled before analysis.
A date table was created using the DAX function CALENDER() before the data modeling.
Since the first month of sales was in July, July was adopted as the beginning of the fiscal year.
